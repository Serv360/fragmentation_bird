## How to run

Main path:

### Package requirements

Python: package required are listed in the requirements_python.txt file. I used the python environment associated with QGIS 3.34.14 (3.12.8 (main, Dec 20 2024, 15:21:15) [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)]). To be able to use this environment with vscode, I followed the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qobogVuXtJU.

QGIS: the fragscape package is not compatible with QGIS versions 3.3X.XX and later. I therefore used version 3.28.9.

R: R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt) - Eye Holes (packages used are listed in the requirements_R.txt file)
